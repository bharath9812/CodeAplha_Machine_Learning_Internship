# CodeAlpha - Machine Learning Internship Projects

## Overview

This repository features four machine learning projects completed during a Machine Learning internship at CodeAlpha. These projects encompass a range of tasks, including credit score classification, handwritten character recognition, emotion detection from audio data, and cardiovascular disease prediction. Each project highlights my hands-on experience and growth in machine learning, demonstrating my ability to address real-world challenges through the application of various techniques and methodologies.

## 1. Credit Score Classification

**Overview**  
Classifies individuals' creditworthiness to predict the likelihood of loan default.

**Dataset**  
[Credit Score Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/bank-credit-scoring)

**Model Pipeline**

- Handled missing values by removing rows with NaN entries.
- Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder` and scaled numerical features with `StandardScaler`.
- Implemented Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
- Used `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal model settings.

The Gradient Boosting model achieved a high accuracy rate, with key features such as balance and age having a notable impact on predictions. The results were validated with example predictions to ensure their practical reliability.

## 2. Emotion Recognition from Audio Data

**Overview**  
Classifies emotions from audio recordings using deep learning techniques.

**Dataset**  
[Toronto emotional speech set (TESS) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess)

**Model Pipeline**

- Extracted Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from audio recordings to represent spectral and temporal features.
- Built and trained a CNN model designed to process these MFCC features for emotion classification.
- Used a softmax activation function for multi-class classification to identify emotions.
- Saved the trained model for future predictions and deployment.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy and a confusion matrix. Verified the model with example audio recordings in the notebook to demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world emotion classification.

**Model Summary**  
The model showed good performance in emotion classification, making it suitable for practical applications in sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction. The effectiveness of the model was confirmed with example predictions.

## 3. Handwritten Character Recognition

**Overview**  
Recognizes handwritten characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the A-Z Handwritten Characters dataset.

**Dataset**  
[A-Z Handwritten Alphabets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)

**Model Pipeline**

- Resized images to 28x28 pixels and converted them to grayscale.
- Applied data augmentation techniques like rotation and translation to enhance the training set.
- Developed a custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers to capture hierarchical image features.
- Trained the model using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy and a confusion matrix. Verified the model with specific examples of handwritten characters in the notebook to confirm its recognition capabilities.

**Model Summary**  
The CNN model achieved strong accuracy in recognizing individual characters and demonstrated good generalization to new data. Results were verified with specific examples to ensure reliable character recognition.

## 4. Disease Prediction from Medical Data

**Overview**  
Predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient medical data, including features such as age, height, weight, blood pressure, and various lifestyle indicators.

**Dataset**  
[Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

**Model Pipeline**

- Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
- Trained multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Implemented an ensemble model using a Voting Classifier to enhance predictive performance.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- Split the data into training and testing sets for comprehensive model evaluation.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC scores. Verified the ensemble model with specific examples in the notebook to ensure its effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular disease.

**Model Summary**  
The ensemble model, which leverages multiple classifiers, demonstrated a solid accuracy rate and robustness in predicting cardiovascular disease. The results were validated with specific examples to ensure the model's practical effectiveness.
